**ChipCraft** is an open-source digital design automation (EDA) framework that automates front-end to back-end IC implementation.  
It integrates synthesis, floorplanning, placement, routing, and timing closure into a single modular environment.  
Ideal for VLSI learners and researchers who want to explore open hardware design.

### `Steps to Install ChipCraft and Run GUI`

### 1. Clone the ChipCraft Repository

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/vsdprogram/ChipCraft
cd ChipCraft
```

---

### 2. Setup Dependencies

Before building, ensure all dependencies are installed.

```bash
sudo ./install_deps.sh
```

---

### 3. Build ChipCraft

Once dependencies are installed, build the main environment:

```bash
./build_chipcraft.sh
```

ðŸ“¸ Example Output

---

### 4. Verify the Installation

Source the environment and check if the tools run correctly:

```bash
source ./env.sh
chipcraft --version  
chiprun --help
```



---

### 5. Run a Sample Design Flow

To test your setup, execute a demo design flow:

```bash
cd examples/demo_flow
make run
```

ðŸ“¸ Example Output

### 6. Launch the Graphical Interface

Visualize your layout results using the built-in GUI:

```bash
make gui_view
```


âœ… **Installation Complete!**  
Youâ€™re ready to explore the full RTL-to-GDSII flow with ChipCraft ðŸš€
